# The Body Shape Calculator - A passion project

This project is a passion project that I created to help women understand their body shape so they can find clothes that are the most flattering to their shape.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the website depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Input their measurements and receive their correct body shape in the results

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

I originally did this project using Vanilla JS soon after learning to code. As soon as I learned React I knew I wanted to refactor it into a react app. I decided to make a full blown website out of it instead of just having the calculator. This gave me great practice with using React components, holding information in state, and passing data around with props.


### Continued development

Another feature in the works for this app is an AI style chatbot that the user can access to ask additional questions about how to style their body shape, what they should buy, etc. I would also like to bring in some links to clothes through an API that would be good for the user's particular body shape.
