                    <h3>Clarity</h3>
                    <p>Have you ever bought something you saw an influencer on IG wearing only to realize it looks terrible on you? The reality is that clothes look different on different people because their shapes are not the same.</p>

                        <p>As women, it can be hard not to look in the mirror and pick yourself apart. Knowing your body shape allows you to view your body as a whole, instead of just a bunch of parts you may or may not like.</p>

                        <p>You know all those clothes in the back of your closet you bought but never wear? Once you know your shape,  you'll know what items in the store will work for you and can start buying things you'll actually wear. How great is that?</p>

                            <p>The way the calculator determines your body shape is by comparing 
                            3 main body measurements: your shoulders, your waist, and your hips. The 
                            calculator then compares these measurements against each other and tells
                            you your body shape! 
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            It's important to remember that all body shapes are beautiful and unique and 
                            this calculator is only here to help, it is not meant to be negative in any way.
                            This is simply a tool to help you achieve your style goals! So grab your measurements 
                            and let the calculator work its magic!âœ¨
