                        3 main body measurements: your <span>shoulders</span>, your <span>waist</span>, and your <span>hips</span>. The 
                        calculator then compares these measurements against each other to determine
                        the shape of your body! 
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        It's important to remember that all body shapes are beautiful and unique and 
                        this calculator is only here to help, it is not meant to be negative in any way.
                        This is simply a tool to help you achieve your style goals! So grab your measurements 
                        and let the calculator work its magic!âœ¨

                                <p>Have you ever bought something you saw an influencer on IG wearing only to realize it looks terrible on you? The reality is that clothes look different on different people because their shapes are not the same.</p>
                    
                            <h3>Positivity</h3>
                                <p>As women, it can be hard not to look in the mirror and pick yourself apart. Knowing your body shape allows you to view your body as a whole, instead of just a bunch of parts you may or may not like.</p>
                
                            <h3>Simplicity</h3>
                                <p>You know all those clothes in the back of your closet you bought but never wear? Once you know your shape,  you'll know what items in the store will work for you and can start buying things you'll actually wear. How great is that?</p>

                                <p>Look into a full length mirror or get someone 
                                to assist you</p>

                                <p>Wrap the tape measure around the fullest 
                                part of each area, making sure you keep the tape 
                                horizontal to the floor. This will give you the
                                most accurate results.</p>
